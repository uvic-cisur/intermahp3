Key differences:
	Relative risk data is internal, several options
	Because of new RR data structure, R base integration is replaced by fixed finite sums at integer evaluation points
	This means population statistics are immediately turned into related gamma distribution evaluations
	Behaviour near 0 is unstable, but we were already explicitly trying to deal with this by setting 0.03 to be the hard lower bound
	This will hopefully be so much faster than the previous implementation that fast Monte Carlo uncertainty intervals will be feasible
