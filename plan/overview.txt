Key differences:
	Relative risk data is internal, several options
	Because of new RR data structure, R base integration is replaced by fixed finite sums at integer evaluation points
	This means population statistics are immediately turned into related gamma distribution evaluations
	Behaviour near 0 is unstable, but we were already explicitly trying to deal with this by setting 0.03 to be the hard lower bound
	This will hopefully be so much faster than the previous implementation that fast Monte Carlo uncertainty intervals will be feasible

Interface:
	intermahp3 will be an API for Shiny App
	in particular, we can eschew considerations for ease of use on the human-package-scripting front
	
Structure:
	intermahp3 constructs a mahp object
	mahps are R6 classes

AF Sheets:
	These are produced as simply as possible
	Split into Partially Attributable and Wholly Attributable
	Further into Simple and Binge (i.e. just injuries and ischaemic, CSUCH Risks)
	WA sheets are populated with 1's and 0's, then updated whenever scenarios and drinking groups are added
	PA sheets are populated with baseline 100% consumption gammas, then updated whenever scenarios and drinking groups are added
	Adding a new scenario involves adding a new gamma (or two new, for binge sheets), evaluating the scenario integrand and denominator,
		then evaluating AFs for each drinking group
	Evaluating the AF for a drinking group (other than FD) involves summing a subset of the scenario integrand with possible boundary
		variation considerations, then division by the scenario denominator
	Adding a new drinking group involves adding a new entry to the dg list, then evaluating the group's AFs for each scenario
